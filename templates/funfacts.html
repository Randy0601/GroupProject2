<p>
<br>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> No. 1 Most Expensive Coffee Comes From Elephant's No. 2 <br> <small> - Canadian entrepreneur Blake Dinkin, 44, is betting his life savings that he can turn his idea into, well, gold. Here's the catch: His Black Ivory Coffee is made by passing coffee beans through the not insubstantial stomachs of elephants and then picking the beans out of, well, yeah, that.</small></h2>
<br/> 
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Earth’s Strongest Coffee Launched to Astronauts in Outer Space <br> <small> - On June 28, Death Wish Coffee literally launched a freeze-dried, instant version of its insanely intense coffee into outer space aboard SpaceX CRS-15 on Friday, July 29. Once there, the coffee (which was packaged by NASA in astronaut drink pouches reminiscent of Capri Sun juice packs) will be enjoyed aboard the International Space Station (ISS).</small></h2>
<br>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Shepherds discovered coffee in Ethiopia circa 800 A.D <br> <small> - Legend has it that 9th century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating coffee berries. A local monk then made a drink with coffee berries and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee was born.</small></h2>
<br/>    
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> There are two types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. <br> <small> -  Seventy percent of coffee beans are Arabica. Although less popular, Robusta is slightly more bitter and has twice as much caffeine.</small></h2>
<br/>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> The majority of coffee is produced in Brazil. <br> <small> - Brazil produces 40% of the world's coffee, which is twice as much as 2nd and 3rd place holders, Colombia and Vietnam.</small></h2>
<br/>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Hawaii is the only state in the U.S. that commercially grows coffee. <br> <small> - Kona coffee is the United States' gift to the coffee world. Because coffee grows best in climates along the equator, Hawaii's weather is optimal for harvesting coffee beans.</small></h2>
<br/>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Coffee was originally a food. <br> <small> - Coffee berries were mixed with fat to create an energy-rich snack ball. It was also consumed as a wine when made from the pulp of coffee berries.</small></h2>
<br/>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> You can overdose on coffee. <br> <small> - However, you would need to drink over 100 cups to consume the lethal dose of caffeine.</small></h2>
<br/>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> New Yorkers drink almost seven times as much coffee as the rest of the U.S. <br> <small> - However, Finland is the most caffeinated country, where the average adult consumes the equivalent of four or five cups of coffee a day.</small></h2>
<br>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Coffee was the first food to be freeze-dried. <br> <small> - The process of freeze drying — when fresh foods are placed in a dryer where temperatures drop to negative 40 degrees F — first started during World War II to preserve foods.</small></h2>
<br>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> Coffee is the second most traded commodity on earth. <br> <small> - According to the Global Exchange, there are approximately 25 million farmers in over 50 countries involved in producing coffee. The number one commodity? Oil.</small></h2>
<br>
<h2><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> In Italian espresso means "when something is forced out. <br> <small> - This refers to the way espresso is made — forcing boiling water through pressed coffee grounds. And, although espresso has more caffeine per volume than coffee, because it's consumed in smaller quantities, it actually has about a third of the amount of caffeine as a regular cup of coffee.</small></h2>
